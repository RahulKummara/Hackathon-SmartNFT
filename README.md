## Problem Statement / Use Case  
NFT creators and collectors currently rely on hype and subjective opinions for pricing digital assets. This leads to overpricing, undervaluation, and mistrust in the NFT ecosystem. There is a need for a smart pricing engine that can predict fair market value based on objective data.

## Abstract / Problem Description  

NFT (Non-Fungible Token) assets often suffer from extreme pricing volatility, largely due to a lack of data-backed valuation models. Our project, **SmartNFT**, introduces an AI-powered pricing solution that predicts the real-time value of an NFT based on multiple features such as artwork properties, creator credibility, rarity traits, and engagement statistics.

The aim is to bridge the gap between creators and buyers by offering a transparent, trustworthy, and intelligent valuation tool. Built with a machine learning model (Random Forest Regressor), the system is trained on a diverse dataset of NFT attributes and market values. The interface is simple and intuitive, allowing users to input specific NFT details and receive an accurate price prediction.

The web interface is built using HTML, CSS, and Flask, providing a seamless experience for creators, collectors, and analysts alike. SmartNFT enables fairer pricing in the NFT market, democratizing access and helping avoid manipulation or misjudgment of digital asset values.
